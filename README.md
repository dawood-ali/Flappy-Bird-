# Flappy-Bird-
The game flappy bird using Arduino 3.5" TFT screen and mcufriend library with features from TFTGLUE.h

This game would be most convenient to run using a 3.5" TFT screen with a pre-equipped/ soldered shield since the display is specifically
made for the 3.5" screen.

The response to the bird requires you to set a button to DIGITAL PIN 45 on your arduino board.
This game doesn't require an SD card linkage to the screen since all images are generated from within the code for convenience.
